## Project Name: Pacmen  

## Description:
Packmen Factory is an animation file in which pacmen moves from one wall boundry to another bouncing back and forth.
Here you can add as many pacmen that you want. An image of a Pacman is added each time you hit the button. Then all of them will bounce around.

## Installation:
Just clone the repository. Then use the index.html on any browser. 

## Usage:
Free to Use

## Support:
Akhila Kulkarni

## Future Improvements
In future I would like to add controls for the user to manipulate the direction of pacman and add some purpose for the movement of pacman.

## Licence
Full information is included in the Licence file.
